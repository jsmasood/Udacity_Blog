Just how important is home advantage and how much of a role does it play? In order to probe this question I used data from the leagues in eleven European countries, covering eight seasons (2012-2016). The dataset is publically available here - https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer.

The code is in Python and the following libraries were used:

- SQLite3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Bokeh
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Geopandas
- IO
